					The memories that Yang stores in <span style = "font-style: italic;">After Yang</span> are just short clips, only a few seconds long. Small moments from the day that Yang wanted to save and store. We watch these clips from his perspective and begin to understand something intangible about who he was. The Internet is full of these small, archived moments. Images, videos, tweets, sounds. The smallest, most mundane details of our lives populating our personal archives and oscillating within the shared memory bank of the Internet archive. Away from the archives of the ‘good and the great’, the digital archive now extends itself around the everyday.<span class = "footnote">29</span> Collections of information from our lives, moments, details, pieces of identity, copies of physical selves. These digital bodies extend our physical bodies from the private and into the public space  The digital archive becomes a form of tertiary memory, an augmentation and extension of our memory, both outside of and of ourselves, both individualized and collective. The structures of human memory itself are transformed through the capacities of technology - storing the minutiae of our digital lives, our memories, our traces.<span class = "footnote">30</span>

					What is this compulsion to store, save, and collect? Somehow the smallest details become precious when they enter into memory. In <span style = "font-style: italic;">Archive Fever</span>, Derrida discusses the human drive to archive, “It is to have a compulsive, repetitive, and nostalgic desire to return to the origin, homesickness, a nostalgia for the return to the most archaic place of absolute commencement”.<span class = "footnote">31</span> Derrida uses this word <span style = "font-style: italic;">commencement</span> in the context of the etymology of the word archive, which he traces to the greek word <span style = "font-style: italic;">arkhe</span>, meaning both <span style = "font-style: italic;">commencement</span> and <span style = "font-style: italic;">commandment</span>.<span class = "footnote">32</span> For Derrida, the nature of the archive is two-fold, tied to both history (commencement, the things that were) and law (commandment, authority, the social order).<span class = "footnote">33</span> The place of absolute commencement is the root, the primordial source, the unattainable, unreachable time that was, the rivers of nostalgia. The drive towards this place of absolute commencement is our drive to recapture the lived moment. To materialize our intangible, transient, and incomplete traces of the past.<span class = "footnote">34</span> The uncanny nature of memory perhaps haunts us in a way. We feel only the fleeting sensations of the lived past, the feeling of some sort of truth that is out of reach. The fabric of the commencement is not just the threads of great events, but the textures of the everyday. Through the archive, we seek to recapture these details. In the words of the philosopher Stanley Cavell, "The everyday is what we cannot but aspire to, since it appears to us as lost to us".<span class = "footnote">35</span>

					In Proust’s <span style = "font-style: italic;">In Search of Lost Time</span>, memories are called upon and triggered unexpectedly and these ‘involuntary memories,’ spontaneous and momentary sensations and impressions of the past<span class = "footnote">36</span>, give the narrator a feeling of an essence, a distillation of some lost, precious fragment of time -

					“No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory – this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me it was me. ... Whence did it come? What did it mean? How could I seize and apprehend it? ... And suddenly the memory revealed itself. The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it. And all from my cup of tea.” <span class = "label" style = "padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; font-style: normal;">(Proust, <span style = "font-style: italic;">In Search of Lost Time</span>)</span>

					Indeed, this is one of the most human aspects of memory. The existence of associate cues, that for whatever reason, retrieve for us some traces of the past. The essence experienced in the moment of remembrance can contain more meaning than the past experience itself. Its poetic substance comes from its absence in the tangible, material world and its textures paint our dreams. It is the impression, not the reproduction, that feels the most true. In Walter Benjamin’s <span style = "font-style: italic;">Arcades Project</span> (1927-1940), the everyday life of the city of Paris is archived, each minute detail and impression recorded and left ‘to speak for themselves’.<span class = "footnote">37</span> Textual montage is used to capture the immediacy, the movement, and the complexity of everyday life in the city. The work itself provides the cues to summon up half-remembered memories, those essential fragments of lost time.<span class = "footnote">38</span> We are brought back to the complex temporality of the archive, which exists both in the past and the present. Like the lateral linkages of the Internet, our memories are linked to associative cues, they emerge from the archive and into the experience of the present. Into that virtual, potential space. What is the essence of memory in the context of the digital space? - A complex web of associations, traces, details, moments, impressions, linkages, infinitely extending out in both past and present tense.
