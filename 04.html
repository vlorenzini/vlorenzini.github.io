				<h1>The infinite archive</h1>
				<p id = "quote">
					“Design is literally everywhere and this includes archives. But exactly how does design show up in archives? Graphic Design, for example, can be rampant. Letterhead, business cards, forms, annual reports, advertising, newspapers, magazines, books, ephemera, brochures, logos/branding, are all examples design and appear in many archives. Consider photographs. Do you have images that include buildings? People wearing clothes? Cars? People eating and drinking?” <span class = "label" style = "font-style: normal;">(Whitlock, <span style = "font-style: italic;">All archives are design archives. Preclude to a manifesto.</span>) </span>

					The design archive provides an interesting example as we consider the complexities of digital/physical memory. In the words of Paul Rand, “Everything is design, Everything!” .<span class = "footnote">39</span> If we provide ourselves with the framework of the digital archive, its physical extensions, masses of data, minutiae of daily life, blurred boundaries, lateral linkages, and multi-temporalities, the ‘everywhere-ness’ of design becomes an intriguing opportunity to imagine new methods of archiving. Let’s imagine a web of infinite visual associations, to the point of ‘absolute commencement.’ In this infinite web, every image that exists in the archives of the digital space becomes connected. These linkages can follow a logical associative path, or perhaps be rooted in something more ‘essential’, something intangible.

					Following the example of Jennifer Whitlock in <span style = "font-style: italic;">All archives are design archives</span>, let’s imagine a photograph of a person wearing a t-shirt with a logo on it. How would this image be archived? How would an algorithm categorize it? What is it connected to? Within one image, infinite layers of association exist. We could call these layers the infinite depths of the digital ‘memory,’ the digital archive. Let’s imagine we are an algorithm. How do we link this photograph to other digital objects, other pieces of data? Perhaps we could find other photographs of people wearing the same shirt with the same logo. We could find  other logos that are similar to this logo. We could find other graphic forms that are similar to this logo. We could find everything that uses the same colors of this logo. We could find the company of the logo. We could find that company’s  previous logos. We could find every instance of this logo that has ever been recorded. We could find who is wearing the shirt with the logo in the photograph. We could find who else is wearing the shirt with the logo in other photographs. In videos. We could find every logo that has ever existed. Every photo of a person wearing a shirt with a logo. What if we put ourselves in the position of the designer of the logo? What were the inspirations for the logo? What is the historical precedent? What research did they do before making this logo? What tools did they use to make it? Who made those tools? What other designs have they designed? What designs did the designer see as a child? What inspires them? How does this design make them feel? How does it make other people feel? What does this design remind them of? The archive of a single design object branches out into its own memory tree. Archives within archives within archives.

					Using the concept of inventive rather than reproductive knowledge, we can explore the implications of the infinite archive within the context of the design archive. How can new forms of knowledge be created through its structures? How can meaningful connections be made from a sea of infinite associations? These questions are difficult to answer, but it seems that the potentials of the digital archive space are ripe for knowledge production. If we expand the confines of the design archive away from the single object and out towards all of its iterations, all of its traces in the digital space, and then out even further towards all of its associative linkages, perhaps a new way of seeing and knowing could emerge. Of course, in considering the concept of the ‘infinite,’ certain existential implications also arise. While the digital archive provides opportunities for new forms of knowledge and new textures of both individual and collective memory, it can also be overwhelming in its massive scope - its layers of detail, minutiae, grains of sand. Our individual bodies are processing huge amounts of information while our digital tertiary memory continues to propagate.  The data multiplies. How does this extend and impact the physical body? McLuhan postulates that the extension of ourselves into technology results in a state of numbness.<span class = "footnote">40</span> Pieces of our physical selves, our memories, become removed from us. Augmenting in the virtual depths, the body and the machine become one.
