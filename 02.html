					How can we understand the contents and structure of digital memory? In the recent film <span style = "font-style: italic;">After Yang</span> (2021) <span class = "label" style = "font-weight: 400;">*SPOILERS AHEAD*</span>, a family in the near future is given access to the memory bank of their beloved robot, Yang, after he suddenly becomes unresponsive. Each day, Yang has been able to store a single moment from his life in this memory bank, just a small recording from the day. The father of the family eventually downloads, views, and experiences these saved recordings using VR glasses. We see the memories in 3D space as a beautiful, glowing tree of data, branching out into the void of virtual space. You can zoom in, select a memory, watch, rewind, and repeat. There are not one, but multiple layers of these memory trees that one can access and descend into, unravelling all of Yang’s past lives. In its broadest definition, we can understand an archive as memory itself.<span class = "footnote">16</span> Rather than the traditional concept of documents housed in a physical space, archive as memory is immaterial, ephemeral.<span class = "footnote">17</span> We can understand the digital archive in a similar vein, in the words of the media theorist Kris Paulsen, an “ephemeral, doubtful, distant, present-tense sign”.<span class = "footnote">18</span> It is both material and immaterial, tangible but distant, past and present.<span class = "footnote">19</span> What are Yang’s memories exactly? Indexes of a database, sequences of pixels? An instance of transistors on a silicone chip? How does Yang experience them? What algorithms decide which ones will be saved? Do hierarchies form, do the memories adapt? This all might be quite speculative, but it serves as an interesting and quite poetic example as we consider digital models of ‘physical’ memory.

					Increasingly, it is computations that archive digital data and the internal structure of these archives is hidden from us, like the hidden layers of deep learning algorithms.<span class = "footnote">20</span> In the process of archiving, digital objects become abstracted, like the traces left behind on the Mystic Pad, or the mind’s abstraction of the sensory data it receives. The algorithms used to archive them are generative, looped, and constantly optimized.<span class = "footnote">21</span> The image of a Mandelbrot Set comes to mind, an infinite recursive loop that descends into ever more detailed iterations of itself. In a sense, the archive is ‘alive,’ it is active. Typical notions of static, aging documents no longer apply in the digital framework. Our digital memory trees continue to branch, grow, and change on an infinite loop, existing in their own liminal dimension of space and time. New temporalities are opened, the data is updated, accessed, stored deeper, re-drawn, linked, expanded. The archive extends out its antennae, and draws it back.

					The founder of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners Lee, envisioned the web creating “a new culture of memory” in which information is widely accessible, dynamic, interactive, and unpredictable.<span class = "footnote">22</span> Beyond the ‘liveness’ of the algorithmic structures of the digital archive, the data that is ultimately retrieved and displayed on our web pages continues to become activated, participating in a dynamic relationship with the person who has retrieved it. Through the use of hypertext, objects are linked laterally and can be accessed from multiple directions.<span class = "footnote">23</span> This lateral, rather than hierarchical linkage is at the core of the Internet’s design. Indeed, the origins of the World Wide Web can be traced to a mnemonic program called “Enquire” that operated on a system of lateral links between arbitrary nodes.<span class = "footnote">24</span> In discussing the program, Berners Lee states that it was, “. . . something I found really useful for keeping track of all the random associations one comes across in real life”.<span class = "footnote">25</span> A traditional, physical archive does not support the exploration of such random associations. In its dynamic state, the Internet cooperates with the associative mechanics of the human mind and through these linkages, new forms of knowledge can emerge from the ‘archive’, rather than simply be retrieved.<span class = "footnote">26</span> A dual process of transformation occurs, as the pathways of the digital space are defined by the workings of the human subject and the human subject become transformed through the acquisition of knowledge. <span style = "font-style: italic;">In Meno and the Internet: Between Memory and The Archive</span> (1999), the philosopher Howard Caygill discusses the difference between inventive knowledge and reproductive knowledge in the context of memory and the emergence of the World Wide Web. As he puts it, “Instead of memory being understood as a realm to which we have to descend in order to bring back objects of knowledge, it can be understood laterally in terms of the links or paths between different, existing configurations of experience”.<span class = "footnote">27</span> <span class = "footnote">28</span> Like our memories, the memory stores of the Internet, the universal knowledge bank, can become emergent, activated, linked, triggered, and transformed in both digital and physical manifestations.
