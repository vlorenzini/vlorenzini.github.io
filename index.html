					“Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central
					nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as
					man — the technological simulation of consciousness . . . Whether the extensions of
					consciousness . . . will be ‘a good thing’ is a question that admits of a wide solution.” <span class = "label" style = "font-style: normal;">(McLuhan 1964, 11)</span>

					The tools that we make to aid and/or expand our sensory abilities typically mimic the human sensory organs themselves. Current developments in virtual reality technology use the human visual system as a model to create ‘human eye resolution’ screens.<span class = "footnote">1</span> Sensors track the user’s gaze and increase the screen resolution at the point of focus, mimicking the machinations of the human eye.<span class = "footnote">2</span> Theoretically, if the technology can perfectly match the physical correlative, the virtual world will appear as real as ‘reality,’ and the user will feel as though their physical body is present in the virtual space. In this perfect iteration, human and technology become seamlessly linked in a dynamic loop of input and output that is calibrated to the exact physicality of the subject and the minute specifications of the technology. In <span style = "font-style: italic;">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</span>, media theorist Marshall McLuhan argued that technology and the physical body were inherently connected. Rather than being seen as a ‘detachable object’<span class = "footnote">3</span>, a separate entity from the human subject, McLuhan writes of technology as an extension, a multiplication, a progression, and a transformation of the ‘psychic and social complex.’<span class = "footnote">4</span> The individual body and the collective culture being both augmented and mutated by the tools we create.<span class = "footnote">5</span>

					Though McLuhan was writing before the emergence of the Internet, in one of his most prescient works, <span style = "font-style: italic;">The Gutenberg Galaxy</span> (1962), he speculates about the next chapter of human existence, the so called “new electronic age.” In this final of technological development, McLuhan imagines a “Global village,” a place in which technology disseminates knowledge to everyone, everywhere.<span class = "footnote">6</span> In this space, where information is accessible in its totality, the boundaries of consciousness become dissolved and technology, in its final stage, becomes the very “extension of consciousness”.<span class = "footnote">7</span> Although quite utopian in its affect, reading this now can feel a bit uncanny. The Internet acts precisely as this global network of information, and to echo McLuhan’s thinking, it can be understood as a mimicry, an augmentation, and a connection of and between our physical forms.

					In 1924, Freud wrote a similarly prescient and intriguing essay titled, <span style = "font-style: italic;">A Note upon the Mystic Writing-Pad</span>. In this essay, Freud discusses a new technological invention, the Mystic Writing Pad, a rather simple device comparable to the Magic Slate that allows a user to write on a wax slab while leaving traces of what was written before underneath its covering. Freud saw in this device a metaphor for the human memory system. “If we imagine one hand writing upon the surface of the Mystic Writing Pad while another periodically raises its covering sheet from the wax slab, we shall have a concrete representation of the way in which I tried to picture the functioning of the perceptual apparatus of our mind”.<span class = "footnote">8</span> In Freud’s thinking, this apparatus consists of two layers. The conscious and the unconscious. The space of perception, which ‘writes’ on the pad, and memory, which contains traces of what has been written.<span class = "footnote">9</span> In his words, “an unlimited receptive capacity for new perceptions and...permanent – even though not unalterable – memory traces of them”.<span class = "footnote">10</span> <span class = "footnote">11</span> While the two systems are linked, the flow of information is not constant, rather, it is as though “the unconscious stretches out feelers, through the medium of the (perception) system...towards the external world”.<span class = "footnote">12</span> It is a moment in which perception and memory come together, something like a virtual space.<span class = "footnote">13</span> An archive of our past experiences that is latent until triggered with the right combination of inputs.

					What would Freud have made of today’s computers? Compared to the Mystic Pad, they are practically the perfect mnemonic tool. They are a simulacrum of the human memory system with the ability to encode, store, and retrieve information ‘infinitely’. The ‘traces’ of input are saved as data, preserved (nearly) completely intact rather than as mere impressions. Layers of storage systems are organized vertically and laterally, with memories that stay on the surface or are lodged deeper on magnetic disks and tapes.<span class = "footnote">14</span> And what about the Internet? It is something like a shared memory bank, an archive, and in the language of McLuhan, an extension of the collective conscious. The home of the virtual space, the unconscious, the vast sea of all data stored in massive data centers, and the collective perception system with its blank pad always ready for new input. The technology of the mind is mirrored in the technology of the computer, each extending one to the other in an infinite feedback loop, transforming both our collective memory and the contents of the digital space and its physical materials.<span class = "footnote">15</span>
