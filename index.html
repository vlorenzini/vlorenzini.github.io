				<p>St. Pius X Health Centre Tatum has been serving the village of Tatum, Cameroon since 1968. Tatum is an isolated region with limited access to larger medical facilities. Since September 2018, the connection to Kumbo, the nearest city, was blocked for vehicles. This has made the work of St. Pius X indispensable. With health insurance being almost nonexistent in Cameroon, it typically falls upon family members to meet the costs of treatment. St. Pius X is committed to treating all members of the community, including the poor and vulnerable, and supporting them as much as possible. The health centre has worked in collaboration with international health organizations like Medicines for Humanity and is one of the leading refferal locations in the region. The centre utilizes up-to-date clinical services and a holistic approach to health to provide thoughtful and professional care to its patients. Collaborations with advanced facilities (St. Elizabeths in Shisong, Baptist Hospital and the District Hospital in Ndu) enable a stable network for further refferals. Furthermore, the centre ensures its staff are well-equiped and informed on new modalities, offering classes once a month. Over the past two years, we have seen the centre continue to grow, with increased use of services recorded across the board.</p>

					<p id = "engage-text">Assitance has been instrumental in sustaining the services provided by St. Pius X. Financing health care workers, supporting the poor and vulnerable, and paying for renovations has been difficult during the Covid-19 pandemic. Financial support is still hugely needed to help settle debts for the procurement of medications and materials needed in daily care, to settle bills of patients with poor financial possessions, and for general renovation work. Moreover, the health centre is in need of a monitor for patients in critical condition, as well as drip stands and crutches. They also hope to further equip the canteen so that it can keep up with the basic needs of patients and the indigenous population.</p>
